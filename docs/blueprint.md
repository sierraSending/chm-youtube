# **App Name**: Hope & Fear Forecast

## Core Features:

- Interactive Grid: Display a 2D grid with 'Hope' and 'Fear' on the Y axis, and 'Likely' and 'Unlikely' on the X axis, labelled accordingly.
- Draggable Prediction Blocks: Allow users to drag and drop six distinct color blocks onto the 2D grid to represent their predictions.
- Submission Mechanism: Implement a 'Submit' button that records the final positions of the dragged items.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Deep red (#8B0000), reminiscent of the original image's pinboard background, to set a distinct tone.
- Grid Lines and Labels: White (#FFFFFF) to contrast with the background and clearly define the axes.
- Font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a clear and modern feel; use for axis labels, and other UI text.
